                To calculate max/min length for the image
                we can approximate the maximum teorical
                dimension for the most lossless format
                we will accept (in this case PNG).
                In this case, we can assume that we want
                only images that are smaller than 4032x4032
                pixels, thus leading us to this calculation

                4032 pixel x 4032 pixel x 4 byte/pixel = around 65 MB

                With this in mind, we can safely say that all
                the images the we will receive will be smaller
                than 65.000.000 bytes.

                We will set a 100 bytes minimum length to ensure
                that data is present.
